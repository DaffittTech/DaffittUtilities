# Daffitt Utilities

**DaffittUtilities** is a collection of random utility projects built in Visual Studio 2015. This is not a full featured production project, but is a good start to get me used to using the GitHub repository.

> **DaffittUtilities is still in early stages (alpha). As such, please do not use on production environments until the library reaches release candidate status.**

**If you can donate any time to improve on the project, be it helping with documentation, tests or contributing code please do.**

### Installation
At present the code is pre-release. I haven't decided yet how or if this will be available for production release.

To clone it locally click the "Clone in Windows" button above.

There's a lot of developers out there who could write this stuff a lot better and faster than I and I would love to see what we collectively can come up with so please, if you can help in any way it would be most welcome and benificial for all.
